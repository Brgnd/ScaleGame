Small fixes to existing classes, new classes Brain, Player, ScaleGame

10 Apr, 2019
Lots of changes:

Building the basic graphic UI, adding a basic sprite sheet to use for (it is CC0) now, until better one is made
 (or the existing one is fixed. Everything is a bit of a mess in the ui department, it will be fixed.
Went through many iterations of how to build the UI, finally decided on sprite based. 
Tried doing graphics with swing originally but deemed it a bit work intensive.
Major work in progress still.

Fixing up stuff.

Got the scaleGameApp to draw the sprites. The sprites are in wrong
places but there is logic to the error. also wrong sprites but that is
probably just because I cant count. But a milestone that I finally got
the game to draw stuff. Now I just need to get it to draw the right
stuff and in correct places :p
